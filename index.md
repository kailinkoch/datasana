title: Welcome to my blog

Here is the new home of datasana, the data / yoga ABCs. The name datasana combines data with asana, a yoga posture. Each post will define a yoga pose as well as one or more data tips and tricks geared at data enthusiasts (analysts, data scientists, excel lovers). The goal is to give bite size exposure to both data tools and yoga, two of my interests.

I am a data scientist who loves working with messy data, and a sporadic yogi. I will cite all sources I include in this write up and save code snippets to Github. I will use a yoga themed dataset for demoing all of the data tricks, which I will refer to as the "yoga for all" dataset (Kanorewala et al., 2023)
